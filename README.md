# WC-add-ons
The plugin only works with Woocommerce.
This is a plugin you could use on your cart page to put a list of product with an add to cart button

How to Use:
First add a new WooCommerce attribute named `show_related` make sure you also uncheck the `Visible on Product Page` so this won't up as other details
Then add a new term to that attribute named `yes`
Now on your product settings go to the attributes and add the newly created attribute with the value of yes
This will let you set the products that you want to be shown
Now add the shortcode `cart_add_on` to the page where you want this list of products to be shown
